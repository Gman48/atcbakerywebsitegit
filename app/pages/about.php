            <h2>Audrey Murphy - Baker Genius</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m a mother of one, or rather, I gave birth to one although I tell people I have the equivalent of three children.  I am married after all.  ðŸ˜Š  After more than 30 years in the retail industry, I retired to a quieter, simpler life or so I thought.  That lasted all of three weeks (insert face palm here!).  I canâ€™t sit still and after so many decades of what seemed to be running in place, I went to the one joy that gave me a sense of accomplishment â€“ baking.  The one place that I could start my day with nothing and have something to show for it by the time I was done.  How it all startedâ€¦â€¦</p>
            <p>I can remember helping my Godmother & Grandmothers bake at a very young age although I think they would have redefined what helping meant at that time.  Baking and being in the kitchen for me has always meant home, family, love.  Putting something in front of someone that makes them light up is as rewarding as anything can be.  To know youâ€™ve brought a smile to their face is a precious gift.  As I grew, that aspiration never changed although it manifested itself in different ways.  I began cooking as an early teen and liked to experiment, but I always came back to the little indulgences that make the day brighter when youâ€™re not having a good one.  Iâ€™ve run the gamut of simple recipes like a basic cake to a chocolate chip cookie.  However, 4 decades ago, those were indeed very basic by todayâ€™s standards.  Iâ€™ve tried learning new techniques, experimenting with flavours and textures whether it be a truffles course (that we almost got thrown out of thank you very much [you know who you are] LOL) to attempting mirror glaze in my own kitchen to somewhat surprising and satisfying results.  The one thing that has stayed constant through the years however is fudge.  A singular treat that evokes memories of being in Niagara Falls where everyone stopped to get a slice.  Itâ€™s a shame that it generally can only be purchased by visiting a major tourist attraction.   So here I am, offering a guilty pleasure that you donâ€™t have to drive hours for.  One bite and your eyes widen, and you look to the sky thinking how creamy and delightful and sinfully good as you reach for the next pieceâ€¦â€¦ I hope you enjoy.  Itâ€™s been decades in the making!  </p>
            <p>Does the story end there???  Of course not!!!  </p>

            <p>And now for the puppersâ€¦.</p>
            <p>In my  neighbourhood, having a dog is almost a requirement.   Dogs draw people togetherâ€¦.complete strangers will strike up conversation when it comes to their furbabies.  I am no exception, on my many walks Iâ€™ve learned the names of all the dogs in the neighbourhood as well as their families.  I jokingly asked if I should rent one so I fit in.  There were so many dogs within 6 houses in any direction from me, I started buying dog treats.  Who buys dog treats when you donâ€™t have a dog???  I DO!  So I started thinkingâ€¦.maybe I could make something for my furry friends and fur-nieces.  And yes, I do realize most dogs will eat anything you put in front of them, itâ€™s knowing that what they are eating is safe, wholesome and all natural without any additives/preservatives, salt or sugar.  And letâ€™s be honest, some of us treat our pets better than our spouses!  So letâ€™s get Fido something tasty!</p>
